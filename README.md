# PlinyPad-simple web app

An absolute bare-bones web app.

Web app package configuration started started code generated by Stagehand. See LICENSE.
And further built with Matt Barnett's design of Model-Controller-View-ViewModel
06/10/2016 8:30am, intended to push clean code in master & commented uncleaned code in uncleaned-branch, but somehow ended up the opposite.
Need to check naming and arrangement of code sections again before giving to Matt.
